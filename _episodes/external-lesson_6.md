## Motivations

The motivations for working to ensure that research is reproducible:

* funder, journal obligations
* collaborating with yourself over time and other self-centred benefits
* the benefits to your science: diversity of pipelines, multiverses; collating data across studies; error checking
* the rhetoric of reaction
